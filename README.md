# Project: RecipeHub (Full-Stack)


## Background

This project is a web-based recipe management application with user authentication and admin functionality. It allows users to view, add, update, and delete recipes, as well as search for specific recipes. Admins have additional capabilities to manage ingredients. The application uses a frontend built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The front-end communicates with a backend API.

## Getting Started
